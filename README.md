Simple form for webrowsers (not mobile) to practice form elements. Added a little JS to validate passwords match. Form does not submit, and did not add input validation for name or phone number as that was outside the scope of this learning project. Used custom fonts for the form as well.

This was a good project to learn form elements in HTML and form styling. It was also enjoyable styling the form and adding the highlights for required fields via JavaScript, and the input focus selectors in CSS.
